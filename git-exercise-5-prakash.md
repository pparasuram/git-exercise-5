Create a repo on GitHub that contains a markdown file that answers these questions:
* How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
     - withing each commit we see in sequence of new to old, Date and time of commit, Author and email, and commit hash indicating where the HEAD is.
* How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?
     - git diff <old> <new> will show difference between old and new with anything added to new with ++ and anything removed with --
* What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)
